# Final Challenge

So I wrote two versions of the final challenge.
For the solution to the first version, follow [this link][first].

The second puzzle is similar to the first one, except it is nerfed a bit,
the solution to the second puzzle is similar to the first one, and as an
exercise to the reader, you may challenge yourself to figure out the solution
to the second puzzle by yourself.
